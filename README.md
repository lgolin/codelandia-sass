## About

This project was developed for the first challenge of the **[Codelandia](https://discord.com/invite/QevDJqCzaY)** community. The aim of this project was to practice frontend development by developing a simple news blog.

I already developed this project before with plain CSS. I recently did a Sass course and I decided to applied my new skills developing this website from scratch using Sass. It was so much fun and I really enjoy how Sass makes everything reuseable and more organized.
